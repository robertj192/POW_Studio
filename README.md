## 📖 About

**POW! Studio** was born from a simple need: creating professional comic book layouts shouldn't require expensive software or a steep learning curve.

As a comic creator working on my "Fire and Ice" series, I found myself frustrated with existing tools. They were either:
- Too complex (full illustration suites when I just needed layout)
- Too expensive (subscription-based tools)
- Too limited (basic templates with no flexibility)

So I built POW! Studio - a **free, open-source, browser-based** comic layout tool that focuses on what matters most: **creating professional panel layouts, organizing your story, and exporting pitch-ready scripts**.

No installation. No subscription. No bloat. Just you and your comic.
